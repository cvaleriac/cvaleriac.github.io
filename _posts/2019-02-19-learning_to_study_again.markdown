When you are at school, you are used to study everyday, you build up your own method, you know what is working for you and what is not.

When I started The Full Stack Web Developer Course, I hadn't been "studying" for quite a while, we do not consider working as studying, even if it is always full of new things to learn.

I also started this adventure in coding when my little one was not even two months old. I had, and still have, up and downs with the learning experience, but still determined to get to the end of it.

Sticking to a schedule for studying has been difficult, but the many tools available on this platform are really helping.

I found Study groups, and videos on Learn Instruct are a precious tool for learning while doing, or while seeing someone else doing it.

I also came to the conclusion that it will take lot of experience to be confident in coding, and that the learning experience will never really end. We learn the tools, the logic behing it, but we have to be ready to keep learning. It is an essential part of the web developer, I think.

I decided I had to go back and repeat some key concepts of Ruby, to be able to speak about my code properly, using the right definitions. This, together with practice, will be the key to speed up and finish the course, in my opinion.

There are, of course, parts of the curriculum I enjoyed more than others, but you still have to manage them all together to be able to build something. Being confident about what you learned and what you do is essential.

I know I still have a long way, but sometime this  AHA moments help you to realize what you did, what you are missing and what you need to succeed.
