My first project is finally there and the feeling of having completed it is awesome. It has been hard also getting there, frustrating and challenging. I guess that's what code is about!

At first it seemed scaring, building something from scratch, no tests to run as in previous labs that can guide you through the solution. The instructions seemed a lot of things to do, but the best approach is one by one.

For my project, I decided to build a CLI gem which would scrape the list of best sellers books in Italian. Choosing something that you are passionate about makes things less hard and more interesting.
I watched all the resources available on Learn and attended the CLI project preparation study groups that I could. All that was a great help! Also, talking to fellow students, comparing idea,s and problems was very helpful.

I started creating my classes, after finding the webpage I wanted to scrape. Finding the selector was not difficult, the more difficult part for me was scraping a link from the title, that was redirecting to the book description. Once that was figured out, using Nokogiri again in a new method, everything was much easier for me. 

This was a fantastic learning experience, very important to fix in my mind all the thousands concepts I have been learning till now. Putting what you have been learning in practice is the best way to remember. Also, it feels great when at the end you see the product of your work!
