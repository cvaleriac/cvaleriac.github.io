Finally, the time for the 4th project came, after a troublesome relationship with theJS curriculum session. I simply felt that things in JS were not clicking right in my mind, as it happened with Rails instead.

I was kind of afraid to start this project and felt very challenged and unsure of what  had accomplished till that moment.

Luckily, study groups are always there to help and shed a light on whatever is not working on our projects or just to understand what to expect froma project. Then, I watched the suggested videos, finding also [this](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/javascript/) resource particularly helpful for debugging.

When it was the time to start, I began from creating a duplicate of the Rails Project Repo, adding the gem active_model_serializers and gem â€˜jquery-rails' in my gem file.
Following step, adding //= require jquery in application.js, together with //= require rails-ujs and //= require_tree . 

In order to meet the requirements of the project, for my index requirement, I showed a list of the financial institutions, and the details for the specific financial institution for the show requirement.

In order to meet the has_many requirement, I rendered the list of rollovers present for that specific institution.

I learned a lot during this project too, and as always, learning by doing on a specific project, about which we know every single step, revealed to be the best learning experience, to get closer to JS and its secrets. There's a ton of things to learn yet and to understand better... but, I hope, practice and time will help!
