A first time mom, working full-time in the field of Translations and Social Media, and trying to keep up with my "social" life and family. This could already be enough work for the short 24 hours a day has.  Yet, I felt my career is not going anywhere, or not where I wanted it to go.

I have been freelancing for more than 10 years, with a B.A. in Foreign Languages and Literatures, going from translation to Social Media. The feeling that what I am doing is not appreciated enough, and no matter how good the job you do is, you are only a perfectly replaceable resource behind a computer, who can be only considered less than someone in-house, has never left me.

So, I started looking around, evaluating what possible jobs and career a person with humanistic background can have in a world driven by technology...  

Looking around, discarding ideas, feeling helpless and unsatisfied with my day-to-day work. It was then when I bumped into coding schools ads, and started browsing just out of curiosity, to understand that this is actually something I would like and I could possibly do.

I've never been afraid of changes, whatever the change was.
Borne and raised in Italy, I moved to Spain after graduation, then Greece, and then found myself on a plane heading to NYC to follow the one who was going to be my husband. 
Yet, the idea of leaving the word of literature to enter a word of technology and coding was scaring me more than changing country every few years.

I was constantly thinking "How do a person decide to change totally her career in an already busy moment of her life? Would I be able to code being a total beginner? Do I have the mind set required for this?".  
Luckily, I have a supportive husband, who happens to be an engineer too, who is always pushing me to go beyond my limits and willing to help me find my way through the jungle of coding. So, after spending some time learning on my own, I  decided to apply and start this new challenge.

Tech is a fascinating world, and is open to anyone willing to learn and battle with problems. I am stubborn and motivated enough to face this challenge. 
Actually, I think the Bronte sisters, Jane Austen, and Mary Shelley are also rootingg for me from their books on the shelves, happy to see another woman trying overcome her limits  and entering a traditionally man's world  to get herself a place there.
