When I started studying coding, I could not avoid thinking "Hey, this is something like learning a new language!"

Like for any foreign language, a coding language has a grammar, a structure that you have to learn in order to "be fluent" in that language.

When you start learning a new language, you have a goal in your mind, which is being able to use the language to do something. This something can be holding a fluent conversation, travelling or just reading a book.

This is another similarity between them. When you start coding, you want your code to serve a purpose and the "grammar"  must be correct in order for it to serve this scope. You have an ultimate goal to learn coding. This can be finding a new job, a new carrer, developing an app, etc.  

Having that goal is what gives the motivation to keep learning, even when things starts to get harder.

O course, there a lot of differences too between learning to code and learning a language, but finding similarities with something we already know or we are good at, helps avoiding to get scared of the unknown world of coding for beginners.
