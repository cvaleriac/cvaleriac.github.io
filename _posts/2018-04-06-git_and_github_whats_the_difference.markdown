At my first approach with Git and Github, I was convinced they were the same thing. It did not take me long to realize they are different, and they both are very powerful and useful tool for developers.

Git is the distributed version control system. Git is responsible for keeping track of changes to content and it provides mechanisms for sharing that content with other developers.

If you are working at a new project and you want to store all the files for that in a directory, but you know things are going to change a lot while working, and sometimes you have to revert back to a previous version.

You can install Git on your computer. Then, you create a new project directory for you and tell Git you want to keep a history of changes. Then, you can start working adding your files.

When developers create something, they make constant changes to the code, always releasing new versions. Git keeps these revisions, storing them in a central repository. In this way, developers can collaborate more easily, downloading a new version locally, making changes and updates and then uploading the new revision. Every other developer in the project can see the changes, and keep contributing.


GitHub is a Git repository hosting service, but with many other features. Three of them make it a very powerful tool: forking, pulling and social networking.

Forking a Repo
“Forking” is when you create a new project based off of another project that already exists. You can fork a repo, make changes and updating your current work

Pull Requests
If you have made some changes to a project, you can creat a pull request, so that other developers can see them and accept it into the project.


Social networking
This is a very cool and powerful feature of Github. Every GitHub user has its profile, which works as a resume, showing all your past work and contributions.
